# 2. Add Two Numbers

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Topics:** Linked List, Math, Recursion
- **Status:** ✅ Solved
- **Problem:** https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/

## Problem Statement

You are given two **non-empty linked lists** representing two **non-negative integers**.

- The digits are stored in **reverse order**.
- Each node contains a **single digit**.
- Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do **not** contain any leading zero, except the number `0` itself.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**

```text
l1 = [2,4,3]
l2 = [5,6,4]
```

**Output**

```text
[7,0,8]
```

**Explanation**

```text
342 + 465 = 807
```

### Example 2

**Input**

```text
l1 = [0]
l2 = [0]
```

**Output**

```text
[0]
```

---

### Example 3

**Input**

```text
l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9]
l2 = [9,9,9,9]
```

**Output**

```text
[8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= Number of nodes in each linked list <= 100`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- The input lists represent a valid non-negative integer.
